Notes:
TRON 2.0: Security Protocol is currently in PRE-ALPHA testing phases. Nothing seen within this pack should be treated as final content, although your feedback is always welcome.

This expansion has been developed with LDSO's TRON 2.0: Killer App Mod in mind. This expansion may not function properly or to its fullest extent if you do not have the Killer App Mod installed.

If you downloaded the .ZIP version of this expansion, you're going to need to take a couple extra steps to get it to run properly on your machine. Please visit this link for more information: https://trello.com/c/nrzljAdg/3-installing-the-killer-app-mod

Background:

TRON 2.0: Security Protocol puts you in the eyes of the ICPs. You are IndexMonitor.exe (just IndexMonitor for short), an ICP soldier designed to index all system files and monitor file transfers, edits, overwrites, and infections. You're the first to know if there's corruption or otherwise suspicious activity loose, but after making some modifications to your source code, most of the notifications you receive go directly to the Kernel now. This left you much more time to perform other tasks.. such as actually fighting off the virus that you've been tracking for a while.

You recently escaped from the ENCOM Lab Server reformat. Your mission had effectively been completed, and you escaped to a remote storage disk where you would await debriefing from the Kernel and transfer back to the ICP Bin to receive new objectives. Unfortunately, when there's a rampant virus running amok, it's not the best idea to trust everything will go according to plan...

TRON 2.0: Security Protocol features an all-new singleplayer campaign with unique attributes - including a Shooting Range, accessible in the first level of every chapter so you can keep your skills sharp. It also features the ability to use Sec Rezzers for yourself, should you ever need to call for some much-needed backup.
