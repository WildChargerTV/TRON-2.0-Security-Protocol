Documenting the way around for future reference

When inside Custom/SecurityProtocol, all custom files must be REZ'd. No customrez.txt is needed.
To avoid REZing, place any custom files in the tcdg folder.

Make sure profiles are not carried over between mods to prevent save corruption.

When hue shifting, average is 140 for red, xxx for yellow. Exact hue shifts do not need to be saved as original copies of textures should always be kept.
