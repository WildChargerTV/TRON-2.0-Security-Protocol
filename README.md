# TRON 2.0: Security Protocol

A TRON 2.0 mod by WildCharger

## Drive reformat in progress...

Thank you for your interest in **TRON 2.0: Security Protocol**. At present, the mod is being entirely reorganized as a project, and wil be restarted from the ground up. All updates following this one will be considered part of that new project.

The version of TRON 2.0: Security Protocol currently available is a cosmetic change that sees an ICP Regular replacing Jet in performing the disc-throwing animation at the main menu. Future updates will build on this as they become available.

More information will be available soon. Thank you.
