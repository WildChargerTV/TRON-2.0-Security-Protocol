# TRON 2.0: Security Protocol, a TRON 2.0 mod by WildCharger

## Drive reformat in progress...

Thank you for your interest in TRON 2.0: Security Protocol. At present, the mod is being entirely reorganized as a project, and wil be restarted from the ground up. All updates following this one will be considered part of that new project.

The version of TRON 2.0: Security Protocol currently available is a cosmetic change - upon booting the game and arriving at the main menu, an ICP Regular will have replaced Jet in the disc-throwing animation.

Future updates will be available soon. Thank you.


## Installation & Uninstallation

To install TRON 2.0: Security Protocol, download the provided .zip file, and extract it into the folder holding your installation of TRON 2.0. This will add the option to launch the mod to your launcher's Custom menu.

To uninstall TRON 2.0: Security Protocol, navigate to your TRON 2.0 installation. From there, enter the Custom folder, and then the Mods folder, and delete the folder inside Mods named "SecurityProtocol". 

Dedicated installation & uninstallation programs may emerge at a later time; however, the mod is not yet complex enough to require this.
