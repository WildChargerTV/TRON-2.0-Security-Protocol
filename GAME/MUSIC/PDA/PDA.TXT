;

; number of intensities that are defined
NUMINTENSITIES 7

; initial intensity to start playing (use 0 for none)
INITIALINTENSITY 1

; optional volume to set music playback to (default is 0) volume is in decibals and can be negative or positive
; negative numbers reduce the volume and positive numbers increase the volume
INITIALVOLUME 0
VOLUMEOFFSET -600

; number of pchannels to use
PCHANNELS 256

; number of voices to use
VOICES 64

; sample rate for synthesizer to run at
SYNTHSAMPLERATE 44100

; reverb can be either on or off. Default is OFF.
REVERB OFF

; specify the reverb Input Gain in decibels. The default value is 0. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBINGAIN 0.0

; specify the reverb Mix in decibels. The default value is -10.0. A value of 0 means 100 percent wet reverb 
; (no direct signal). This value is a floating point value.
REVERBMIX -10
; Specify reverb decay time, in milliseconds. The default value is 1000. This value is a floating point value.
REVERBTIME 1000

; Specify reverb RBTime value. Ratio of the high frequencies to the global reverb time. Unless very bright 
; reverbs are wanted, this should be set to a value less than 1. The default value is 0.001. This value is a 
; loating point value.
REVERBHIGHFREQRTRATIO 0.001

; intensity definitions 

; format is INTENSITY <intensity number> <times to loop (-1 for infinite loop)> <intensity to switch to when finished or 0 for stop> [any number of segments]

; Transitions (only transitions that are not going to use MEASURE MANUAL with no transition segment
;			   need to be defined)
;
; format is TRANSITION <from intensity> <to intensity> <when to enact transition> <automatic or manual> [optional segment to play if manual] [optional chordmap if automatic]
;
;	when to enact transition = SEGMENT, MEASURE, BEAT, IMMEDIATE, GRID, MARKER, DEFAULT (defined in segment)
;
;	automatic or manual = AUTOMATIC for directmusic automatic transition, MANUAL for manual playing of transition segments (if no 
;						  transitions are specified for manual then no transition happens new intensity just starts playing)
