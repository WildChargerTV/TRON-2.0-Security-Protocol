**                 ----------[TRIGGERTYPES]----------
**
**  TriggerTypes are responsible for associating specific map triggers -
**  ones that the player should be made aware of - with textures that
**  will appear onscreen to inform the player that they are nearby one
**  of these triggers.
**
**  This file allows for the selection of TriggerTypes in DEdit, but
**  only appears in the basic Trigger class. The game will then use this
**  file to associate the TriggerType with the icon texture that it's
**  supposed to display, and show it when appropriate.
**
**  There are only two TriggerTypes defined here, and TRON 2.0 does not
**  use either of them directly. TransAM is unused, and Exit Trigger is
**  not used in the context of default Trigger classes; rather, TRON 2.0
**  opts to use a dedicated ExitTrigger class instead, which might still
**  use it, but doesn't allow it to be changed.
**
**  TODO confirm that's how TriggerType1 is used.
**
**  Name (String)
**	    - The user-friendly name of the TriggerType. This is what will
**      show up in DEdit.
**  Icon (Path String)
**      - The texture that will appear in the HUD when the Trigger's
**      conditions are met.
