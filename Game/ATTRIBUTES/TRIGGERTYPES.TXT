/************************************************************************
**
**                 ----------[TRIGGERTYPES]----------
**
**  The TriggerTypes file manages attributes for all of the game's
**  various Trigger Types.
**
**  TriggerTypes are responsible for associating specific map triggers -
**  ones that the player should be made aware of - with icon textures
**  that will appear in the HUD to inform the player that they are close
**  to one of these triggers.
**
**  This file allows for the selection of TriggerTypes in DEdit, but
**  only appears in the basic Trigger class. The game will then use this
**  file to associate the TriggerType with the icon texture that it's
**  supposed to display, and show it when the trigger's HUDLookAtDist
**  and/or HUDAlwaysOnDist parameters have been satisfied.
**
**  There are only two TriggerTypes defined here, and TRON 2.0 only uses
**  the second one for exit triggers. TransAM is unused, assumedly a
**  leftover fragment of NOLF 2.
**
**  Adding a new TriggerType is safe and has no effect on the game. It's
**  recommended to use a 64x64 texture to display on the screen. The
**  texture's exact positioning on the screen is unfortunately locked
**  and cannot be manipulated.
**
**
**  Name (String)
**	    - The user-friendly name of the TriggerType. This is what will
**      show up in DEdit.
**
**  Icon (Path String)
**      - The texture that will appear in the HUD when the Trigger's
**      conditions are met.
