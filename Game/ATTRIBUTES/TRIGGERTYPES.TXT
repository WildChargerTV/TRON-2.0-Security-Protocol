/************************************************************************
**
**                 ----------[TRIGGERTYPES]----------
**
**  The TriggerTypes File manages attributes for all of the game's
**  various Trigger Types.
**
**  Trigger Types are responsible for associating specific map triggers
**  - ones that the player should be made aware of - with icon textures
**  that will appear in the HUD to inform the player that they are close
**  to one of these triggers.
**
**  This File allows for the selection of Trigger Types in DEdit, but
**  only appears in the basic Trigger Class. The game will then use this
**  file to associate the Trigger Type with the icon texture that it's
**  supposed to display, and show it when the trigger's HUDLookAtDist
**  and/or HUDAlwaysOnDist Value parameters have been satisfied.
**
**  There are only two Trigger Types defined here, and TRON 2.0 only
**  uses the second one for exit triggers. TransAM is unused, assumedly
**  a leftover fragment of NOLF 2.
**
**  Adding a new Trigger Type is safe, and has no effect on the game.
**  It's recommended to use a 64x64 texture to display on the screen.
**  The texture's exact positioning on the screen is unfortunately
**  locked, and cannot be manipulated.
**
**
**  Name (String)
**	    - The user-friendly name of the Trigger Type. This is what will
**      show up in DEdit.
**
**  Icon (Path String)
**      - The texture that will appear in the HUD when the trigger's
**      conditions are met.
