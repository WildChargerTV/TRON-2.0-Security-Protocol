**                  ----------[RELATIONDATA]----------
**
**  The RelationData File mainly serves to set up AI "factions", which
**  then gets applied to all of the AI in the game. This allows NPCs to
**  know how to react when encountering both the player and each other.
**  This process includes creating specific AI categories, which are
**  then assigned a single set of relations. Although it is possible to
**  modify these relations on-the-fly by assigning them to a Collective,
**  such functionality is unfortunately not used in TRON 2.0.
**
**  This File has four sections: RelationalObjects, Collectives,
**  RelationSets, and RelationData.

/************************************************************************
**
**                ----------[RelationalObjects]----------
**
**	RelationalObjects, also known as Alignments, are responsible for the
**  first step of the process, which is to create AI categories. Every
**  NPC in TRON 2.0 that isn't part of a cutscene, or doing a scripted
**  action, will be required to have an assignment to one of these AI
**  categories in order to properly exhibit traditional behaviors.
**  Without one, the NPC doesn't have a way of of receiving a Relation
**  configuration, and will subsequently react to absolutely nothing.
**
**  The primary way to assign these to an NPC will be by setting its
**  Alignment Attribute (in the "Attribute Templates" section of the
**  AIButes file) to one of these RelationalObjects. That assigns a
**  default relation data set to the AI, which can then be overridden as
**  needed within DEdit by modifying the Alignment setting in the
**  AttributeOverrides menu.
**
**  It's important to clarify the use of the word "Alignment" in this
**  section, because literally every other part of the dev tools (that
**  we can see) refers to these as Alignments and not RelationalObjects.
**  Actual alignments are set in the RelationData section.
**
**
**	Name (String)
**      - The name of the RelationalObject. This is the key that all
**      of the other tools will use to interface with this File.
**
**	RelationSet (String)
**		- The name of the RelationSet to assign to this RelationObject.
**      Only one RelationSet can be assigned. Use an empty String ("")
**      if no RelationSet is to be used.
** 
**	RelationData (String)
**		- The name of the RelationData to assign to this RelationObject.
**      Only one RelationData can be assigned. Use an empty String ("") 
**      if there is no RelationData to be used.
** 
**	Collective (String)
**		- (Optional) The name of the Collective to assign to this
**      RelationObject. Only one Collective can be assigned. Use an
**      empty string ("") if there is no Collective to be used.
**      - Although it appears as if Collectives were experimented with
**      during development, they are effectively unused in the final
**      Retail release, although potentially still functional.

**  Collectives are assigned to a RelationSet which it will dynamically
**  change over time.
**	
**	An AI's RelationSets will subscribe to Collectives as sources of 
**  information. Information which is not in the Collective may still be
**  different for these AIs. Whenever information matching that listed
**  in the Collective is uncovered, the Collective learns that 
**  information, and it remains until the Collective releases it.
**
**  Collectives are unused in TRON 2.0, as all NPCs in the game are
**  intended to have static alignments. Use at your own risk.
