**                      ----------[PINGS]----------
**
**  The Pings file sets up all of the necessary elements to display the
**  HUD element reminding the player of various progression-related
**  events, such as a character calling them over an I/O Node, or an
**  info mark telling the player they have received a new objective,
**  subroutine, help file, or version number upgrade.
**
**  This file has two sections: Pings and Characters.

/************************************************************************
**  
**                                 Pings
**
**  This is the section that defines individual pings and assigns them
**  to characters. Generally speaking, the game will just reference the
**  same ping whenever its invocation is needed. With the exception of
**  Mercury, no two I/O Node callers overlap one another, and other
**  ping types use a different, likely hard-coded set of rules.
**
**
**  Name (String)
**      - The name of the Ping. It's usually recommended to set this to
**      be the same as the Character field.
**
**  Character (String)
**      - The Character name (defined in the Characters section) that
**      the Ping will be assigned to.
**
**  Trigger (String)
**      - (Optional) The trigger command to send if the player chooses
**      to respond to the Ping.
**      - Note that in most cases this goes unused, and is highly
**      discouraged.
**
**  Cancel (String)
**      - (Optional) The name of the Ping to remove when this Ping is
**      activated. Only used in cases where one Ping replaces another.
**      - Note that in most cases this goes unused, and is highly
**      discouraged.
**
**  ---[SAFELY DEPRECATED VALUES]---
**  Image (Path String)
**      - The texture to use for the ping's portrait. This overrides the
**      default ping frame texture.
**      - Unused. There's no need to use this when portrait textures are
**      defined in the Character section.

**      a Ping's default portrait.
**
**	IsCharacter (Boolean Integer)
**      - Determines whether or not a '<x> has pinged you!' message will
**      appear onscreen when a Ping with this Character is activated.
**      -- 0: The message will not appear when the Ping is activated.
