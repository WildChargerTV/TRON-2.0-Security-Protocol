**		               ----------[CLIENTSND]----------
**
**  The ClientSND file (short for Client Sound) does one thing and one 
**  thing only: specify the path to the folder containing the game's 
**  voice lines for use in Single Player.
**
**  All voice lines in the game must have their name set only to their
**  associated ID, as well as a .LIP file that translates the voice line
**  into lip syncing animation instructions. When the game calls the ID 
**  of a string in CRES.DLL to use for subtitles, it will also call the 
**  voice line and .LIP file of the same ID in this directory.
**
**  TODO is a .LIP absolutely necessary? Or is the game able to ignore
**  it when missing?
**
**
**  Dialogue (Path String)
**      - The path to the folder containing the game's voice lines, with
**      the Game folder acting as the root. Must end with a backslash to 
**      note the end of the path, but does not need one at the beginning
**      of the path.
