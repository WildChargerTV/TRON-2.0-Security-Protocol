**                       ----------[MUSIC]----------
**
**  The Music file is responsible for "importing" the music control
**  files into the game itself, and allow it to set up its dynamic music
**  system.
**
**  In TRON 2.0, the music system is not a simple linear track; rather,
**  it is a system that uses track segments, which is exactly what the
**  name implies: it accepts tracks, splits them into segments, and then
**  uses an internal system to play all of the segments in a sequence
**  that is set by a dedicated control file. Other attributes, such as
**  the timings the game will use to properly overlap the segments, are
**  stored in that specific segment's companion file, which uses the
**  .SGT format.
**
**  The only way to properly add your own music into the game is to
**  use Microsoft DirectMusic Producer, which is responsible for making
**  the .SGT files that the control file can read from. A tutorial on
**  how to do so may appear at a later date, but no guarantees.
**
**  This file has two sections: Settings and Tracks.
**
**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
**  
**  There are two elements of the dynamic music that are controllable:
**  moods and events. These concepts are represented in the music's
**  intensities and motifs respectively.
**
**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
**
**  Moods are essentially the game's normal background music, and are
**  the system responsible for allowing the music to respond to the
**  current game state.
**
**  At any given time, only a single mood will be playing. Any number of
**  events/motifs can play on top of this mood. There are four moods in
**  total:
**      1. None - Silence. In TRON 2.0, this isn't supposed to occur
**      naturally, however does still happen every so often. The "music"
**      that plays in this mood is just set up to reference no sound
**      files at all.
**      2. Routine - Ambient music. This should be the default state of
**      music in TRON 2.0. If the mood is set to None, it can easily
**      return to this state, or a higher one, whenever there is any AI 
**      activity near the player.
**      3. Investigative - Moderate intensity music. This plays when a
**      hostile AI has become aware of the player's presence, but is not
**      yet engaged in combat.
**      4. Aggressive - Combat music. This will pretty much always be
**      playing when an AI is engaged in combat, regardless of whether
**      it is with the player, or with other AI.
**
**  The game determines the current mood by constantly checking these
**  four states top-down (from Aggressive to None) and seeing if each
**  specific mood is being stimulated by an AI that is within the
**  player's visibility. If it can't find any AI, then it will default
**  to None as the mood. If multiple intensities are assigned to a
**  single mood, the game will pick one at random when transitioning to
**  it.
**
**  This logic is not set in stone, however. The MinMusicMood DEdit
**  property can change the default minimum music mood. The two most
**  notable examples of this are the Transport Station (Vaporware) and
**  the Main Power Pipeline (Antiquated). A command can also easily
**  force the music intensity to change to a different mood at any time.
**
**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
**
**  Events, as stated before, are additional music cues that can play
**  on top of the current mood when an AI either dodges, or dies from,
**  an attack. Although TRON 2.0 does not actually use events, they can
**  still be set up by adding motifs inside the music control files
**  themselves. If multiple motifs are assigned to a single event, the
**  game will pick one at random to play on a per-event basis.

**
**  This section defines specific settings pertaining to the music.
**  
**  
**  DodgeChance (Float),
**  DieChance (Float)
**      - The percentage change that the game will play a motif when an
**      AI dodges or dies from an attack respectively. Any values above
**      1 will be treated as 1, but it is recommended to keep the value
**      between 0 and 1.
**      - This is unused in TRON 2.0, but is still fully functional.

**                                 Tracks
**
**  This section defines all of the specific music tracks the game can
**  use. Because they are strictly based on their name, they do not need
**  to be defined in a specific order; however, all of the section
**  headers must be fully lowercase.
**
**
**  None# (Integer),
**  Routine# (Integer),
**  Investigate# (Integer),
**  Aggressive# (Integer)
**      - The intensity to read from the control file for each of the
**      four different moods.
**  
**  AIDie# (String),
**  AIDodge# (String)
**      - (Optional) The name of a motif to play when an event occurs
**      while this track is currently playing. The name must directly
**      correspond to the same name as defined in the track's control 
**      file.
**      - This is unused in TRON 2.0, but is still fully functional.
