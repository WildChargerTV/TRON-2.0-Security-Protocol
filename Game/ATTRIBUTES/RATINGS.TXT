**                     ----------[RATINGS]----------
**
**  The Ratings file defines some of the core parameters with regard to
**  the five Performance Ratings. It also manages the Transfer Rate
**  rating's transfer times specifically.
**
**  TRON 2.0 Performance Ratings are fairly straightforward. The player 
**  collects Build Points throughout the campaign, which contributes to
**  increasing their major version number. Once the player has received
**  a major version upgrade, they are given a number of Build Points to 
**  allocate to these five ratings. As a rating improves, so too does
**  the respective stat being upgraded. Once a rating has received a
**  maximum point investment, it will enter Surge status, in which the
**  mechanic receives a significant boost as a reward for reaching that
**  point. All point allocation is irreversible once the Subroutines
**  menu is closed, but unallocated points are saved indefinitely for
**  future allocation at any time.
**
**
**  PointsPerLevel (Integer)
**      - The amount of points that are awarded to the player whenever
**      they reach a major version upgrade.
**
**  InitialPoints (Integer)
**      - The amount of points that are given to the player at the start
**      of a campaign, or when loading into a custom map.
**      - Because this is a global setting, it is highly discouraged to
**      change this, and instead use the AddBuildPoints command in DEdit
**      to provide the player an initial version number greater than 0.
**
**  MinValue (Integer),
**  MaxValue (Integer)
**      - The minimum/maximum amount of points that can be allocated to
**      each of the five Performance Ratings. This is a permanently
**      shared setting that cannot be changed per rating.
**
**  InitialValue (Integer)
**      - The amount of points initially allocated to each of the five
**      Performance Ratings at the start of a campaign, or when loading
**      into a custom map. 
**      - Because this is a global setting, it is highly discouraged to
**      change this, and instead use the AddBuildPoints command in DEdit
**      to provide the player an initial version number greater than 0.
**
**  <ItemTransfer> (Custom Vector)
**      - The remaining fields all set transfer times (in seconds) for 
**      all of the game's item types, including transfers from Archive
**      Bins and Core Dumps.
**
**      - The field's accepted data value is in the syntax of a Vector.
**      All values are times in seconds. 
**      -- The first value defines the transfer time when the Transfer 
**      Rate rating is at the MinValue.
**      -- The second value is intended to define the transfer time
**      when the Transfer Rate rating is at the MaxValue. However, this
**      value is not ever truly reached, because a rating at MaxValue
**      goes directly to Surge status, and therefore uses the third
**      value instead.
**      -- The third value defines the transfer time when the Transfer
**      Rate rating has reached Surge status.
**
**      - The different types of transfers are described as follows:
**      -- AlphaSubTransfer, BetaSubTransfer, GoldSubTransfer: For
**      Alpha, Beta, and Gold Subroutines respectively.
**      -- ProceduralTransfer: For the Disinfect, Defrag, and Port
**      Procedurals. Fully functional, although no Procedurals are
**      obtained in this way in the game.
**      -- PrimitiveTransfer: For the "5" Primitive weapons. The "Hands"
**      "weapon" counts under this category, but getting it in this way
**      doesn't actually have any visible effects. The other four work
**      as intended.
**      -- PsetTransfer: For the 8 in-game Permissions.
**      -- EmailTransfer: For Email files.
**      -- HelpFileTransfer: For Help Files. Fully functional, although
**      no Help Files are obtained in this way in the game.
**      -- CustomTransfer: For an arbitrary "item", or an item that does
**      not apply to any of the above categories, like a Video Archive.
**      Transferring a Custom item simply executes a custom command, or
**      does nothing if no command was given.
