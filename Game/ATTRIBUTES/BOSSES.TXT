**                     ----------[BOSSES]----------
**
**  Given Monolith's original description of this file, it seems that
**  it was, at one point, responsible for storing information for all of
**  the ingame bosses in TRON 2.0 during development. Most of this data
**  was later transferred to AIBUTES, meaning whatever was left in this
**  file - which is just data for a Thorne bossfight - is either unused, 
**  or could not be moved in time before release.
**
**  It is not yet known whether the Thorne data here corresponds to the
**  Thorne bossfight in the Progress Bar.
**
**  Below is Monolith's original description of the file.
**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
**  This file is a dumping ground for all variables various Tron
**  specific bosses should use. Ideally, this would be integrated into
**  the AIButes, but to keep Tron specific information out, I decided to
**  put it here for now.
**
**  Note that there are no templates or structures. Every field will be
**  documented individually.
**  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
**  Further documentation has been temporarily withheld until it can be
**  confirmed that the game still references this file for the Thorne
**  "fight" in the Progress Bar. Monolith's original documentation has
**  been left intact.
